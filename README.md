Welcome to the auto-dj! Before you run this program, there is one thing that needs to be taken into consideration.</br>
</br>
If you want to make alterations to the library text file, the formatting has to be with the songs first in alphabetical</br>
order, followed by all of the playlist. A playlist will be denoted with the name following a "-" symbol, with individual</br>
songs on each line following. For the import and discontinue files, each song needs to occupy one line with no whitespace</br>
in between. Here is an example of what the files should look like:</br>
</br>
