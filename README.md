12/4 Connor Robinson--
I added some necessary functions to song, as well as updating and filling out some functions for inventory and playlist
also i made it so playlist doesnt extend list because that doesnt work, it should be good now
cmakes looks way better, works the same
text me if you are confused about anything ill be there toward the end of class
you guys may wanna focus mainly on getting a fucntional prototype working
